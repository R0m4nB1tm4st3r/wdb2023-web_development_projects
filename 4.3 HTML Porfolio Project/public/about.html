<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  As of today I have collected a total of four and a half years of experience in
  Software Development - the last one and a half year especially on Web
  Development. Currently I am more skilled at Frontend Development, but I want
  to improve on the Backend as well. I also have interests in Game Development
  which is why I will visit the SAE Institute.

  I am really into gaming. For the most part I play Action RPGs like the Souls
  games from FromSoft. Recently I had some nostalgia flashback which made me
  play Resident Evil again. Other Hobbies include watching Anime. There I don't
  have any genre-specific preferences - I watch everything that catches my eyes.
