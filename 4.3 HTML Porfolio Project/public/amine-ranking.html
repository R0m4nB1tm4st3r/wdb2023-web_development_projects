<h1>The Top 5 Anime Series according to Roman </h1>
<h2>A selection of my favourite anime series</h2>
<p>(the order does not reflect how i would rank them!)</p>
<hr />
<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p
  >I loved the fights and all the stuff around the life as a pirate when i was a
  kid.<br />
  And i still love it today - especially with these sick animations going
  around.</p
>
<h3>Kaiji</h3>
<p
  >I clearly underestimated this hidden gem of a Gambling Anime because the Main
  Character did look kind of shady to me.<br />
  But now I'm glad that I gave it a chance - and was totally blown away by the
  amount of tention going on.<br />
  Although the second season went a bit over the top.</p
>
<h3>Death Note</h3>
<p
  >I think there's no need to say much. It's an alltime classic and can be
  recommended even to people that are not firm with anime.</p
>
<h3>Elfenlied</h3>
<p
  >This was my first real anime and as such I will always keep it in good
  memory.<br />
  It also has an interesting story which got me hook for more anime content.</p
>
<h3>Monster</h3>
<p
  >This mystery thriller is kind of fresh air to people being oversaturated with
  the School/Mecha/Isekai anime number x.<br />
  It's quite an old title but has quite the exciting story - plot twists
  included.</p
